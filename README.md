# register_grid
The register_grid function is used to specify a type of grid that displays.
<br />
Use like ```register_grid($post_type, $config)``` where $post_type is any post type that is registered with the Wordpress system, including custom post types.

<br/>

Calling this function will register a shortcode which will be $post_type appended with -grid. Put this anywhere on your page to display this grid. For instance
```post``` will register the shortcode ```post-grid```.

Shortcodes also allow for the use of a few attributes by default aswell as registered filters.<br />
Eg.<br />
```[post-grid pagination="false" count="4" order="random"]```

<br/>

### Register Grid from Post Type Example
You can register any post type that is in the system.
```php
register_grid("post", [
    "pagination" => true,
    "get_details" => function($id) {
        return [
            "title" => get_the_title($id)
        ];
    },
    "render" => function($details) {
        return $details["title"] . "<br />";
    }
]);

//Use the shortcode [post-grid]
```
<br/><br/>

Also pass it a config option which will be used to specify what details(information) is needed, it will only pull the information that is specified in this function. It will pass an ID to the ```get_details``` property which should then return an array of properties which will then be passed to the ```render``` function. The render item is how each item in the grid will render, all items are looped over and called with this function.

<br/>

### Register Grid from API Example
You can pull data dynamically from an API or custom data source by providing a function as the 'data' property.
```php
register_grid("futurama", [
    "data" => function() {
        $apiUrl = 'http://futuramaapi.herokuapp.com/api/v2/characters';
        $response = wp_remote_get($apiUrl);
        $responseBody = wp_remote_retrieve_body( $response );
        $result = json_decode( $responseBody );
        if ( is_array( $result ) && ! is_wp_error( $result ) ) {
            return $result;
        } else {
            return [];
        }
    },
    "render" => function($details) {
        return $details["Name"] . "<br />";
    }
]);

//Use the shortcode [futurama-grid]
```

To render a grid with no pagination by default you can use the shortcode ```[post-grid pagination="false"]```
To render ONLY the pagination (useful if you wish to seperate the grid from the pagination) you can use the shortcode ```[post-grid pagination="only"]```. The pagination will work with grid of same post type on the page.

<br />


| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `data` | `string`<br />`function()` | Specify source of data, can be the slug of a post type or a function that returns an array of items |
| `render*` | `function($details)` | The function to be looped over when rendering items. Must return HTML |
| `get_details` | `function($id)` | Specify properties/details for individual items, can only be used if data is not specified and data is being pulled from post type.  |
| `count` | `integer` | Default number of items to be shown, will be overidden by shortcode attribute and filtering |
| `class` | `string` | Class to use as the grid wrapper |
| `cache` | `boolean`<br />`integer` | True or false will be on or off, integer will be on and cache timeout in seconds. 3600 by default |
| `order` | `string` <br /> `function($a, $b)` | The order of the items, can be set as  ```random``` or a custom sorting function, which uses usort |
| `pagination` | `boolean` | Whether or not to display pagination |
| `view_more` | `string` | If specified will display a "View More" button with the specific text. Will show more items incrementally i.e lazy loading items. |

# register_filters
The register filters method is used forÂ specifying different parameters that can be used for filtering an existing grid.
It takes two parameters, the first must be the same slug specified in the correlating register_grid function. Filters will only work if a grid already exists. The second is an array of different filters to be used with this grid.
When registering filters you need to specify a ```type``` and a ```match``` function at the very least.

Shortcodes will be generated for all the filters as well as each individual filter if you wish to split them up onto different parts of the page. URL rewriting is automatically handled, if you have multiple grids of different type one page the URL parameters will be prefixed with {post_type}__ e.g. ```?post__query=test+search```

### Register Search from Post type Example
This example should be used with the first register_grid example, and it is a simple query search matching the post title.
```php
register_filters("post", [
	"query" => [
        "name" => "Search",
        "type" => "text",
        "matches" => function ($atts, $details) {
            return wp_ajf_contains($atts["query"], $details["title"]);
        },
    ]
]);

//Use the shortcode [post-filters] or [post-filters-query]
```

<br />

### Register multiple filters for Post type example
This example includes the checkbox filter for anything title with under 10 characters.
```php
register_filters("post", [
    "under-10" => [
        "name" => "Titles under 10",
        "type" => "checkbox",
        "matches" => function($atts, $details) {
            return $atts["under_10"] ? (strlen($details["title"]) < 10) : true;
        }
    ]
]);

//Use the shortcode [post-filters], [post-filters-under-10]
```

<br />

There are a couple of built-in helper filters too.

```php
register_filters("post", [
    // Change the amount of items displayed
    "count" => [
        "type" => "select",
        "options" => [10, 20, 50, 100, 200]
    ],
    // Clear all filters
    "clear" => [
        "type" => "clear"
    ]
]);
```

<br />


| Option | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | `string` | This will be used as the label, exclude to use the filter key |
| `type` | `string` | Can be checkbox, text, select |
| `matches` | `function($atts, $details)` | Used for matching against this filter, must return true or false |
| `icon` | `string` | An icon to be placed next to the filter element |
| `placeholder` | `string` | Only for text input type, placeholder for the input |
| `options` | `array` | Only for select input type, this is all the options. Can be automatically populated with unique options from details array if slug matches |
| `has_any` | `boolean` | Only for ``select`` filters. If false does not have an "Any" option |





# Javascript API
AJF also provides a javascript API which includes event listeners, methods and data access for implementing your own front-end functionality. Here are a few examples.



#### Fade out when filters submitted
```javascript
AJF.on("submit", ({ post_type }) => {
    $(".archive-container[data-post-type='" + post_type + "']").fadeOut("fast");
});
```

#### Fade in when results have loaded
```javascript
AJF.on("load", ({ post_type }) => {
    $(".archive-container[data-post-type='" + post_type + "']").fadeIn("fast");
});
```

#### Log the value of the filter when changed
```javascript
AJF.on("filter", ({ key, value }) => {
    console.log(key, value);
})
```

#### When filters are cleared
```javascript
AJF.on("clear", ({ key, value }) => {
    console.log(key, value);
})
```

#### When pagination button has been clicked
```javascript
AJF.on("page-change", ({ post_type, page_num }) => {
    console.log(post_type, page_num);
})
```

#### Callback when document is ready
```javascript
AJF.on("ready", (data) => {
    console.log(data);
})
```


Return true on any event listener to prevent further event listeners of the same type from firing.

#### Prevent default rendering
```javascript
AJF.on("render", (data) => {
    console.log(data);
    return true; 
})
```


Methods are provided to get the current state of the filters.

#### Get all the current current filter values
```javascript
const values = AJF.getAll();
console.log(values);
```

#### Get all the current current filter values
```javascript
const values = AJF.getAll("post");
console.log(values);
```

#### Get a single filter value
```javascript
const query = AJF.get("query");
console.log(query);
```

#### Get a single filter value for specific post type on page
```javascript
const query = AJF.get("post", "query");
console.log(query);
```

You can also set the value of the current filters, by default this will submit filters, but this can be disabled as explained further down.


#### Set a single filter value
```javascript
AJF.set("query", "search term");
```

#### Set a single filter value for specific post type on page
```javascript
AJF.set("post", "query", "search");
```

#### Set multiple filter values at once
```javascript
AJF.set({
    "query": "search term",
    "under-10": true
});
```

#### Set multiple filter values at once for specific post type on page
```javascript
AJF.set("post", {
    "query": "search term",
    "under-10": true
});
```

#### Set multiple filter values at once for specific post type on page
```javascript
AJF.setAll("post", {
    "query": "search term",
    "under-10": true
});
```

These can also be used ascynchronously, and will be resolved when the data is fetched

#### Set multiple filter values at once for specific post type on page
```javascript
await AJF.set("post", {
    "query": "search term",
    "under-10": true
});
```

#### Set multiple filter values at once for specific post type on page
```javascript
await AJF.setAll("post", {
    "query": "search term",
    "under-10": true
});
```




# Templates and Plugin Development
AJF provides a very simple templating system. To register a template is the same as registering a grid except using ```register_grid_template``` instead of ```register_grid``` and ```register_filters_template``` instead of ```register_filters```.

Here is an example of a template which will render a basic list of posts.

```php
register_grid_template("ajf-post", [
    "data" => "post",
    "pagination" => true,
    "has_nav" => false,
    "include_items" => true,
    "count" => 10,
    "render" => function ($details) {
        return $details["post_title"] . "<br />";
    },
]);

register_filters_template("ajf-post", [
    "query" => [
        "name" => "Search",
        "type" => "text",
        "matches" => function ($atts, $details) {
            return wp_ajf_contains($atts["query"], $details["post_title"]);
        },
    ],
]);
```

Creating a template allows for using amongst multiple grids, without having to rewrite code, and can also be used by plugins to create custom functionality to be used in themes. Filters registered as a template will also be automatically available to a grid that uses the template, without having to register them with ```register_filters```.

To use a template with a grid instead of specifying a configuration initialize it with the name of the template like this.

```php
    register_grid("posts", "ajf-post");
```
and that's it!


But wait, there's more. Say for example you want to override any of the templates configuration, you can just pass an additional config array, the same as you would with the the ```register_grid``` function.

For example if you wish to have a custom data source and turn pagination off while still keeping the same rendering method you can pass an array like this while using a template.

```php
register_grid("posts", "ajf-post", [
    "pagination" => false,
    "data" => function() {
        return [
            ["post_title" => "Post 1"],
            ["post_title" => "Post 2"],
            ["post_title" => "Post 3"],
        ]
    ),
]);
```
